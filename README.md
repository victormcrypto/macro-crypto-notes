# Gold, Bitcoin Discount and Capital Rotation

Gold continues to move higher, reflecting capital positioning toward safety amid macro uncertainty.

At the same time, Bitcoin remains discounted relative to prior cycle highs, despite sharing similar long-term drivers such as monetary expansion and debasement concerns.

Historically, capital rotation tends to follow a sequence:
- First into defensive assets (gold)
- Then into higher-beta assets as liquidity conditions improve

Bitcoin has often acted as a bridge between hard assets and risk assets during these transitions.

With global liquidity showing early signs of stabilization, this divergence between gold and Bitcoin becomes an important signal to monitor from a capital allocation perspective.

Markets tend to close these inefficiencies once liquidity returns.
