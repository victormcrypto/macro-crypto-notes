# Altcoin Season Index – Early Signals of Capital Rotation

## Context
The Altcoin Season Index measures whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin over a given period.
Historically, altseason does not begin with euphoria, but during periods of disbelief and low participation.

## Current Market Structure
- The index is recovering from the lower range (Bitcoin Season zone).
- Similar setups in past cycles preceded broad altcoin expansion.
- Bitcoin dominance remains elevated, which historically creates asymmetric opportunities in altcoins.

## Interpretation
This does not mean altseason has started.
It suggests the market is transitioning from capital preservation to selective risk expansion.

## Key Takeaways
- Altseason is a process, not a single event.
- Early phases reward patience and accumulation.
- Rotation tends to start before narratives appear on social media.
